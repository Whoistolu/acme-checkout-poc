# Acme Widget Co ‚Äì Basket POC

Proof-of-concept sales system for Acme Widget Co.
This project is written in Ruby and demonstrates key software engineering practices:

- **Dependency injection**
- **Strategy pattern**
- **Extensible design**


## Setup

1. Clone the repo
   ```ruby
   git clone https://github.com/Whoistolu/acme-checkout-poc
   ```
   ```ruby
   cd acme-checkout-poc
   ```

2. Install dependencies (RSpec for testing)
